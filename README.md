# a sample
this is a sample repository that exists solely for the purpose of me to learn git on the cli.
this is where i will test things and tool around with the various commands related to git.
i might write silly things in here sometimes.
it probably wont exist for very long, i'll likely delete it.

for convention:
	* an_app.py: an_app.py is a dummy python app which represents the main application of
		this repository. it reads from a file (a_file.txt) and prints each line of it 
		to the console. once the end of the file has been read, the app prompts the user
		for their name, and then returns a response to the console.
	* a_file.txt: a text file containing lines of ascii text that is read by the main 
		application.
	* my_module.py: a module file containing an auxillary function. the function is imported
		by the main application. and is responsible for the ask prompt, which only returns
		True when given alphabetic carachters. Numerals and specials not accepted.
	* __init__.py: python application package file.
	* .gitignore: a list of files for git to ignore
	* README.md: this very file which you now read.
